### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! My name is Justin and I'm a full stack software developer and CS student at the University of Waterloo.
I have significant experience in the field of security software and full stack development. Most recently, I developed an MS Teams chat bot to improve connectivity and kindness at the office as part of my work at [KindWorks.AI](https://kindworks.ai/). I have also worked on a cutting edge hardware security module, a cloud based public key management solution targeting the automotive industry and added support for post quantum cryptography libraries to a Java SDK.

I am currently working on monster tracker for table top roleplaying games, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Zinka010/dnd-monster-tracker)

Previously, I have developed a [weather application](https://github.com/Zinka010/Climatonix) using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [code for robots](https://github.com/FRC2706/2020-2706-Robot-Code) as part of [FIRST robotics competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).
