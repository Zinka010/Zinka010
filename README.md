### Hi there, my name is Justin and I'm a full stack software developer and CS student at the University of Waterloo.
I have significant experience in the field of secuirty software and full stack development. I have worked on a cutting edge hardware security module, a cloud based public key management solution targeting the automotive industry and added support for post quantum cryptography libraries to a Java SDK.

I am a member of the Computer Science Club at the University of Waterloo, to see the code I have written, [click here](https://git.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/jtoft?tab=activity)

I am currently working on monster tracker for table top roleplaying games, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Zinka010/dnd-monster-tracker)

Previously, I have developed a [weather application](https://github.com/Zinka010/Climatonix) using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [code for robots](https://github.com/Zinka010/2020-2706-Robot-Code) as part of [FIRST robotics competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).
