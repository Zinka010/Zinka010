### Greetings! My name is Justin, and I'm a passionate full-stack software developer and Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

My expertise spans both security software and comprehensive full-stack development. I am currently immersed in a Software Engineering Internship at [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com), but I am actively seeking Spring 2024 opportunities. In a recent internship with [KindWorks.AI](https://kindworks.ai/), I spearheaded an MS Teams chat bot, fostering connectivity and kindness within the office environment. I am excited to say that this product is now being rolled out to customers. Furthermore, I've contributed to pioneering projects such as a cutting-edge hardware security module and a cloud-based public key management solution tailored for the automotive industry. I've also augmented a Java SDK with support for open-source post-quantum cryptography libraries while working at [Crypto4A](https://crypto4a.com/).

Previous employers have been very impressed both my technical and soft skills. [A shoutout from KindWorks.AI](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kindworksai_we-want-to-give-a-huge-shoutout-to-the-great-activity-7057842769930715136-F2ej?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios)

Currently, I'm channeling my creative energy into a monster tracker for tabletop roleplaying games, a project that truly excites me. Feel free to explore my work-in-progress [here](https://github.com/Zinka010/dnd-monster-tracker).

In my past endeavors, I've designed a weather application utilizing the Open Weather Map API and developed code for robots as a competitor in FIRST Robotics.

I'm constantly inspired by the ever-evolving landscape of technology, and I'm eager to continue making meaningful contributions to this fascinating field. Feel free to connect and explore the exciting world of software development with me!
