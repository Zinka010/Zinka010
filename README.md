### Greetings! My name is Justin, and I'm a passionate full-stack software developer and Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

At the moment, I am immersed in a Software Engineering Internship at [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com). My expertise spans both security software and comprehensive full-stack development. In a recent internship with [KindWorks.AI](https://kindworks.ai/), I spearheaded an MS Teams chat bot, fostering connectivity and kindness within the office environment. I am excited to say that this project is now being rolled out to customers. Furthermore, I've contributed to pioneering projects such as a cutting-edge hardware security module and a cloud-based public key management solution tailored for the automotive industry. I've also augmented a Java SDK with support for open-source post-quantum cryptography libraries.

Currently, I'm channeling my creative energy into a monster tracker for tabletop roleplaying games, a project that truly excites me. Feel free to explore my work-in-progress [here](https://github.com/Zinka010/dnd-monster-tracker).

In my past endeavors, I've designed a weather application utilizing the Open Weather Map API and developed code for robots as a competitor in FIRST Robotics.

I'm constantly inspired by the ever-evolving landscape of technology, and I'm eager to continue making meaningful contributions to this fascinating field. Feel free to connect and explore the exciting world of software development with me!
